Nightmare is a platformer prototype where you control a physics-based acrobatic character who has the ability to levitate, but only for a limited amount of time. The player must combine carefully timed jumps with this limited levitation to be able to move around the buildings of the level without colliding or losing speed.

## Basic actions
Using the left stick (on gamepad) or the WASD keys, the player can freely run at different speeds. Depending on how far the input is being pushed.

By pressing the south button (on gamepad) or the spacebar, the player can jump. Depending on how long the button is pressed, the player jumps higher or lower. The jumping animation also changes depending on the direction the player is moving towards.

While in the air, the current speed built up is maintained. The player can rotate and change direction mid-air, but they can't change their current speed.
