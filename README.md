Nightmare is a platformer prototype which intends to mimic the feeling of flying in a dream. You control a physics-based acrobatic character who has the ability to levitate, but only for a limited amount of time. The player must combine carefully timed jumps with this limited levitation to be able to move around the buildings of the level without colliding or losing speed.

Animations are from Clazy's *Runner Action Pack* and Kubold's *Movement Animset Pro*.

## Basic actions
By using the *left stick* (on gamepad) or the *WASD* keys, the player can freely **run** at different speeds. Depending on how far the input is being pressed.

By pressing the *south button* (on gamepad) or the *spacebar*, the player can **jump**. Depending on how long the button is pressed, the player jumps higher or lower. The jumping animation also changes depending on the direction the player is moving towards.

While in the air, the player can hold the jump button again to **levitate**. Levitation cancels gravity but it uses up **ego**, an energy meter represented by the blue wheel at the center of the screen. When it runs out, the player can't levitate anymore, and must wait for the ego wheel to regenerate to a minimum before levitating again (when beneath the minimum, the wheel color turns from blue to orange).

The player can rotate and change direction mid-air (regardless of whether they're falling or levitating), but they can't build up speed. To build up speed, they can use the **thrust** action. By holding the *right trigger* (on gamepad) or the mouse's *left click*, the player is launched forward in the direction of the camera. This action uses up a lot of **ego** though
